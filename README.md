# DP1_project

This is a website I've developed as a project for the final exam of the course of Distributed Programming I. 

It's aim was to test our knowledge of the basic features of html, css, javascript and php. 

The UI was not relevant, so I've used some open source css's while we were asked to pay attention to concurrency, security and 
robustness issues. 

The text containing the requirements of the assigment is in the wiki.
